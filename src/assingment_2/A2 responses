Evaluate the following Boolean expressions for a Robot. Assume the robot is on intersection (1, 5) facing north. There is a Wall immediately in front of it. 
In each case your answer will be either true or false.
this.getAvenue(true) > 0
this.getAvenue(true) <= 5
this.getStreet(false) != 1
!(this.getStreet(false) == 1)
this.frontIsClear(false)
!this.frontIsClear(true)
this.frontIsClear(true) == false
2. Consider the following if-else statements. Do they behave the same way or differently? Justify your answer.

Statement 1
if(karel.canPickThing())                                    
{                                                        
    karel.turnRight();                               
} else {                                                   
    karel.turnLeft();                                
}  
Statement 2
if(!karel.canPickThing())
{                                                                          
    karel.turnLeft();
} else {                                                                                                                          
    karel.turnRight();
}   

these 2 statements act differently because the way the robot turns is opposite if using the second option
